# Modeling-Aroma-Profiles-from-Chemical-Components

Accurately predicting the aroma of a molecule based on its chemical structure is a promising direction for advancing the development of flavors and fragrances in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. This study explores the potential of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict aroma descriptors from molecules encoded in SMILES format. A newly curated dataset was developed, comprising 5,855 molecules annotated with 44 standardized odor descriptors. Three models were evaluated on this dataset, namely Random Forest, XGBoost, and TabNet. Molecular feature extraction was conducted using Morgan Fingerprints, and the influence of fingerprint radius on predictive performance was assessed. To address the significant label imbalance, the MLSMOTE data augmentation strategy was also evaluated. Among the tested models, XGBoost trained on an MLSMOTE-augmented dataset with a fingerprint radius of 3 demonstrated the highest predictive performance. It achieved an AUROC of 0.954, a precision of 0.803, a recall of 0.691, and an F1-score of 0.742. In contrast, TabNet consistently underperformed across all configurations, with statistically lower F1-scores compared to the other two ML models. External validation using a cacao-specific molecule dataset revealed a distribution shift between training and test sets, resulting in reduced precision but high recall. Retraining XGBoost directly on the cacao dataset eliminated this performance degradation and significantly improved all evaluation metrics. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models, particularly XGBoost, can effectively predict sensory attributes from molecular structure. This approach offers a reliable and data-driven alternative for accelerating aroma design and reducing subjectivity in product development across sensory-driven industries.
